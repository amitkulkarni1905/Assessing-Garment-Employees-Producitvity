# Assessing-Garment-Employees-Producitvity

Here the goal of the project is to find the different factors which impact the factor of Productivity

So the endeavour was done using Multiple Linear Regression model

By the correlation plot, we found out that 

1) Standard minute value :  Allocated time for a task
2) No of style change : Number of changes in the style of a particular product
3) Team : Associated team number with the instance
4) No of idle men : Number of workers who were idle due to production interruption  

are correlated with Actual Producitivity of the Garment Workers

We have also constructed the Multiple Linear Regression equation to predict new actual productivity value &

We have assessed the performance of the model with Error rate which came out to be 0.23 which is satisfactory

Dataset used here was sourced by Abdullah Al Imran and obtained from UCL Machine Learning Repository
